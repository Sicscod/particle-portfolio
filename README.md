# ✨ Particle Portfolio

A one-file portfolio where **your name is made of particles** that scatter when you move your cursor (or touch the screen on mobile).

**Live demo:** https://sicscod.github.io/particle-portfolio/

## Features
- 🎇 Interactive particle name: mouse and touch
- 📱 Fully responsive, works great on phones
- ⚡ One `index.html`, no build step, no frameworks
- 🎨 Change colors in one place (`:root` in the CSS)
- ♿ Respects "reduce motion", keyboard friendly

## Make it yours (2 minutes)
1. Click **Use this template** (or download the ZIP).
2. Open `index.html` and edit the `CONFIG` block at the bottom:
   ```js
   const CONFIG = {
     name: "Your Name",
     role: 'Designer who makes <em>things people love.</em>',
     email: "you@mail.com",
     projects: [ { title: "...", text: "...", tags: ["JS"], url: "https://..." } ],
     ...
   };
   ```
3. Want other colors? Change `--accent` and `--accent-2` at the top of the `<style>`, and `particles.colors` in `CONFIG`.
